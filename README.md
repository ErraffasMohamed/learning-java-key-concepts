## Concepts Covered

Each directory represents a different Java concept. Below is a list of the key concepts with a brief description of each:

### 1. **Classes and Objects**
   - Example code on creating classes, objects, and understanding the relationship between them.
   - Topics: Constructors, access modifiers, instance variables, and methods.

### 2. **Inheritance**
   - Examples of how to implement inheritance, including single and multilevel inheritance.
   - Topics: `super` keyword, overriding, `Object` class basics.

### 3. **Interfaces and Abstract Classes**
   - Differences between interfaces and abstract classes, with practical implementations.
   - Topics: Abstract methods, multiple inheritance through interfaces.

### 4. **Polymorphism**
   - Illustrates method overloading and overriding for polymorphism.
   - Topics: Dynamic and static polymorphism, `instanceof` keyword.

### 5. **Exception Handling**
   - Basics of handling exceptions, including custom exceptions and the try-catch-finally blocks.
   - Topics: Checked vs. unchecked exceptions, throw and throws keywords.

### 6. **Collections Framework**
   - Working with various collections (List, Set, Map) and understanding their characteristics.
   - Topics: ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap, iterators.

### 7. **Generics**
   - Examples on creating generic classes and methods.
   - Topics: Type parameters, bounded types, and using generics with collections.

### 8. **Annotations and Reflection**
   - Introduction to creating and using annotations and utilizing reflection to inspect classes.
   - Topics: Custom annotations, retrieving annotations with reflection, metadata handling.

### 9. **Threads and Concurrency**
   - Demonstrates creating threads, synchronizing resources, and using concurrency utilities.
   - Topics: Thread class, Runnable interface, locks, synchronized blocks.

### 10. **File I/O**
   - Basics of reading and writing files in Java.
   - Topics: FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, and using the NIO package.

### 11. **Streams and Lambda Expressions**
   - Examples on functional programming with streams and lambda expressions.
   - Topics: Filtering, mapping, reducing, and functional interfaces.
